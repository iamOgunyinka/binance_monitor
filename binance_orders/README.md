Orders
======
This is a self-contain program I use to monitor the state of the orders I make in my Binance account. 
It allows me to receive Telegram notification of my cancelled, fully/partially filled orders. This project is just used as a personal log of all orders carried out on Binance.

It is one part of a three-phase project.
